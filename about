Hello world, I am a software developer from <span style = "color:orange">In</span><span style = "color:#4fc3f7">d</span><span style = "color:#66bb6a">ia</span>.

I am a third year Computer Science undergrad, however, I have been coding for much longer than that. 

My love for computers begane with learning basic programs with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Presently, my main interests lie in AI/ML research, but I love to make low-level projects as well. 

My other interests include:
