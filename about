Hello world, I am a software developer from <span style = "color:orange">In</span><span style = "color:#448aff">d</span><span style = "color:green">ia</span>.

I am a third year Computer Science undergrad, however, I have been coding for much longer than that. 

My love for computers begane with learning basic programs with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Presently, my main interests lie in AI/ML research, but I love to make low-level projects as well. 

I am a firm believer that we must not let computers lose their quirky charm of fun and innovation, which it has. So one of my major aims is to fix the clutter that's now inheritent to it, and make it easier for the newbies and professionals alike to work with code without being overwhelmed. 

My other interests include football (<span style = "color:#2962ff">força</span> <span style = "color:#ef5350">barça</span>), and video games (hah, try beating me at FIFA or PES).
