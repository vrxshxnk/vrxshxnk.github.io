GamesKart was a start-up built by my senior acquaintances and my first real experience with web development before I joined university. I helped in designing the front-end, and in deployment of the website. This was also a valuable experience in e-commerce. Technologies I used while working here include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Shopify API.
