<span class = "project-completed"> GamesKart (2017 - 2018): </span> 

GamesKart was a start-up built by my senior acquaintances and my first real experience with web development before I joined university. I helped in designing the front-end, and in deployment of the website. This was also a valuable experience in e-commerce. Technologies I used while working here include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the Shopify API.

TeeDee was a social media website I founded for my city which failed miserably but taught me extremely valuable things like marketing, SEO, etc. Technologies used to create TeeDee were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. At end of its life, TeeDee had 467 users.
